# Exercise 1, Hello World

> Hello world is often the first program you build when learning to program. You simply program the computer to output a line of text called "Hell World"

This first exercise is the simplest in the git workflow: change, commit, deploy. You have a repository on GitHub that you'd like to work on locally. Make a few updates and then push those changes back to GitHub.

Objectives:
1. Create a repository on GitHub, e.g. `repo-name`
2. Clone directory to your local environment
```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```
3. Make some changes and then publish those changes back to GitHub on the master branch
```
git add file-name
git commit -m "commit message here"
```
